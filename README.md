## Purpose
The purpose of your platform is to provide a decentralized and secure environment for sharing and storing machine learning data using IPFS and web3.storage. This aims to maintain data integrity, cleanliness, and prevent tampering, which are critical aspects for reliable machine learning model development. Furthermore, the platform offers a marketplace for users to exchange data, models, and services, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for machine learning practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## The problems it solves 
- Data Security and Integrity: By utilizing IPFS and web3.storage, your platform ensures that the data remains tamper-proof and maintains its sanity, preventing unauthorized access or modifications. This is crucial for building trustworthy machine learning models.

- Decentralized Data Storage: Traditional centralized storage solutions may suffer from single points of failure, downtime, or censorship. Your platform offers a decentralized storage solution, mitigating these risks and ensuring data availability.

- Transparent Provenance: The platform allows users to trace the origin and history of datasets, ensuring that they can confidently use and build upon them without concerns of copyright infringement or potential biases.

- Access to Quality Data: The marketplace connects data providers and consumers, allowing them to exchange high-quality, pre-processed, and verified datasets. This accelerates the process of developing and training machine learning models.

- Collaboration and Monetization Opportunities: The marketplace enables users to monetize their efforts by selling data, models, or services, while also providing an environment for collaboration, sharing of knowledge, and joint problem-solving among the community.

## FAQ 
### Q1 - Since its on IPFS, the dataset uploaded is immutable so how can someone update the data with upcoming changes/trends?
### A1 - Thats true, the data is immutable, hence the publisher has to release a new version everytime he/she wants to update the data, for eg - NAT.csv 1.0, NAT.csv 1.1.
